      <h2>1. PC Repair Terms</h2>
      <hr class="rgb-divider">

      <h3>Liability Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>
        James Industries LLC is not responsible for data loss, hardware failure, or system issues that may occur 
        during diagnostics or repair. Customers are strongly encouraged to back up all important data prior to service.
      </p>

      <h3>Labor Warranty</h3>
      <p>
        All repair labor is covered by a <strong>30-day warranty</strong>. This warranty becomes void if:

        <li>The device suffers physical damage</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Abandoned Devices</h3>

        and may be recycled, sold, or disposed of to recover service costs.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Payment is due upon completion of service. Accepted payment methods include cash, card, or approved alternatives.

      </p>

      <h3>Payment & Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Custom PC builds require <strong>full payment upfront</strong>. Due to the personalized nature of these builds, all sales

        Benchmark results and performance discussions are estimates. Actual performance varies depending on workload, 
        software environment, and system configuration.
      </p>

      <h3>Shipping</h3>
      <p>
        All systems are tested prior to delivery. If shipping is requested, James Industries LLC is not responsible for
